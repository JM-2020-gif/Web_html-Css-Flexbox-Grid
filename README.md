# Web_html-Css-Flexbox-Grid

\_I decided for this project to build a website of Colombia

\_LIVE DEMO HERE: http://welcometocolombia.surge.sh/

1. The website is built using both: flexbox and grid
2. The choice of colors is adapted to the flag of Colombia (yellow, blue and red) and some extra colors.
3. one-pager
4. html and css: structure = body (container), container (header-main-fotter), main: (six boxes) / each box: (three sections), fotter: icons.
   \_Postscript: the videos are fun and chosen to show you a bit of my beautiful country. Take a break, bring a coffee or drink of your liking and enjoy. \_Thanks for your time.
